# Formatting rules

1. The format of this document is [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
2. Everything in the actual specification document must be ASCII only.
3. The only allowed extensions to original Markdown are tables and code blocks
   (indicated by three backticks).
4. Style
  * Use spaces to indent, not tabs.
  * Use of prefixed `##` is preferred for headers over underlined `===`
  * Use of *inline* links `[example](http://example.org)` is preferred over
    *reference* links `[example][xmpl]` unless used multiple times. This is to
    allow for easier splitting and reorganization.
  * Do not embed external images not hosted on php.net.
  * Try to stick to 80 chars wide, if possible. This is not as strict as
    in code, but still easier to read most of the times. This does only apply
    to text, not to code examples or tables.
